                    By 2030, substantially reduce waste production through, reduction, recycling, and reuse

                    As of today, only 9% of plastics world-wide are recycled <a href="https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-today" target="blank">[1]</a>. This is a real issue as non-recycled plastics
                    end up contaminating the sea, and hurt the ocean life. This is often through microplastics from bottles and bags, it is estimated
                    that up to 80% of microplastics are from land based sources

                <h2>To meet the goal, we need to improve:</h2>
                <p>
                    By making it easier to recycle bottles and cans through digital currency, our aim
                    is to reduce waste. Our theory is that by motivating users for recycling through extrinsic motivation
                    it will be easier for everyday people to partake in it <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/extrinsic-motivation#examples" target="blank">[3]</a>. 
                    Our objective is to lower the bar for recycling, and thereby increase the number
                    of people choosing to recycle their bottles after use.

                <h2>Digital currency for recycling plastic bottles.</h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is to set up scanners in recycling stations to reward recycling of bottles with digital currency.
                    It will also be partnered with an app to register whom is recycling, and a place to reward with said currency.
                    The application will include:
                </p>
                <div id="list1">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Digital currency for recycling at the store</li>
                        <li>A QR-code to scan when recycling to connect the recycling to your account</li>
                        <li>Different options to use said currency you earn on. Such as "pantelotteriet" by Red Cross or any other partnered charitable organisation.</li>
                        <li>A code for you to scan at stores partaking in the solution, to pay with the digital currency.</li>
                        <li>Protected information by an account, in accordance with GDPR.</li>
                        <li>Feedback on recycling statistics, letting the user know how much they are reducing their carbon footprint by recycling.</li>
                    </ul> 
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Our digital currency system and application aims to reduce the number of bottles being thrown in the trash instead of recycled. However, we are aware that a certain percentage of 
                        people in Norway depend on money from recycling bottles to survive. Therefore the application will have a button to donate a given amount of digital currency
                        towards a charity helping homeless people in Norway.
