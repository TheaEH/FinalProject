                    This is going to help people recycle and reuse. Probably, can't see the future.

                <h2>We are going to make an app(original I know)</h2>
                <p>
                    With this app we will develop digital currency rewarded for recycling. Both plastic bottles
                    and glass/metal stuff from recycling stations.
                    This will have functions such as:
                    <ul div id="list1">
                        <li>Digital currency for recycling at the store</li>
                        <li>A QR-code to scan when recycling to connect the recycling to your account</li>
                        <li>Different options to use said currency you earn on. Such as pantelotteriet by r√∏dekors</li>
                        <li>A whole button designated to give your money to an organisation working to improve living conditions for the homeless.</li>
                        <li>Well also sell all your data. Sorry, not sorry.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because hey, we get it. Homeless people like bottles, right? Well since you're recycling their precious
                    precious bottles now, we will give some of your money earned to them. If you want to. We're not your supervisor.
