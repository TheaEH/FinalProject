                <h1>About our solution</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="text1">
                <p>
                    Our solution is called Redivivus. It means reborn in latin, and yes I totally stole it from Infinitum. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our solution can be split into three parts.<br>
                    Our first objective is to outfit recycling machines in stores and recycling stations on the streets of Oslo
                    with scanners both for QR codes and for registering bottles and glass/metal. This is to register the amounts and then send information to our app.
                    
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="text2">
                <p>
                    This is where the second objective comes in: Developing an application. <br>
                    This is to have the digital currency for recycling on your phone. Have you ever had a bottle, but you were on the tram, and therefore
                    you just threw it away in a trash can?
                    By giving the users incentives through extrinsic motivation to recycle the bottle instead, and not having them take cash for it and thereby walking around
                    with two kroners of change, it will be easier to just recycle that bottle. Then the users could save the money and use them at the time they want.
                    It would also be easier for stores, because the code would be accesible in multiple stores. It would also save paper from recycled bottle receipts. <br>
                    Furthermore our application would link each user to an account which would be scanned at the station or machine to link the recycled trash to them. This would
                    also give feedback to us as developers.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="text3">
                <p>
                    Which leads into the third part of the idea. Information: <br>
                    Gaining information about what is being recycled, if said recycled material is wrong and which places in the city needs improvement would
                    make it easier for the different boroughs of the city to advertise targeted areas whom need to improve. This would then lead to 
                    actual places needing to improve to be more mindful and in turn improve themselves. This cuts advertising costs for the government, which in turn
                    could be spent on other means to improve Oslos carbon footprint.
