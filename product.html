                <h1>About our solution</h1>
                <p>
                    Our solution is called Redivivus. It can be split can be split into three parts: Application, Implementation and Information.
                    <br>

                    Application <br>

                    The solution's first objective is developing an application, and have the digital currency rewarded for recycling be displayed on your phone. <br>
                    The application then allows the users to save the money and use them at the time they prefer.
                    Redivivus also offers incentive for usage from stores, as it will save paper from recycled bottle receipts. <br>
                    Furthermore our application would link each user to an account which would be scanned at the  machine to link the recycled bottles to them. This will
                    give feedback to us as developers.
                    
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="white">
                <p>
                    Implementation<br>
                    The second objective is to outfit recycling machines in stores
                    with scanners for QR codes, and explain to the population how the solution makes their everyday life easier.
                    Machines will register the amount of bottles and then send information to our app. In the beginning phase of our solution, Oslo will be
                    the first city to have stores be outfitted with scanners. Eventually we will continue outfitting machines in stores all throghout Norway.

                    Information <br>
                    Gathering information about what is being recycled, supplying the user with individual statistics and which places in the city needs improvement will
                    make it easier for the different boroughs of the city to supply place-oriented advertisement campaigns targeting areas in need of improvement. This will lead to 
                    actual places improving their recycling. As a byproduct advertising costs for the government are cut, which in turn
                    can be spent on other means to reduce Oslo's carbon footprint. Further down the line this will be applied to different cities
                    throghout Norway, and their respective boroughs. Information about an individuals contribution to reducing carbon footprint will also be
                    supplied to the user in the application.
