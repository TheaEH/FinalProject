                <p>
                    Our team had its origin during the mentor week during the start of the semester. All being students taking computer science
                    at Oslo Metropolitan University. We soon became friends and started exchanging ideas and opinions about pretty much everything. After 
                    being given our first obligatory assignment concerning the UN's sustainable development goals, it naturally came up during conversation
                    what we would like to improve and how given the chance. It did not take long for all three of us to realize that climate change, and improving the 
                    environmental situation was something all of us were particularly interested in. With this in mind, we set out to develop a solution to really make
                    a change in todays society, and get everybody on board with recycling.

                    Nicolay is 26 years old hailing from Bærum, just outside Oslo. He has a B.Sc. in economics and business administration, and is currently
                    studying computer science along with the rest of the team. If it is one thing Nicolay believes, then it is that life is about improvement.
                    He is a fan of working out both mind and body, and believes that in order to fully enjoy life one needs a constant drive to better oneself. This is one
                    of the things driving him to further his studies, and also what makes him burn so thoroughly for the task of reaching the sustainable development goal through improvement.
